# Heist Assistant

## Introduction
Made by me as a beginner so your feedback will be very valuable and can help me better. Heist Assistant focused helping people to make money with playing easy heist in GTA Online.
A Lua Script made for [Kiddion's Modest External Menu](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/497052-kiddions-modest-external-menu-thread-3-a.html).

## Download and Install
Download the file `HeistAssistant.lua` then put into `modest-menu_v0.9.4\scripts\ Here`. If your Modest Menu already opened you need to reload script by `Menu Settings > Reload Scripts`. All done, go to `Scripts > Heist Assistant` to use the script.
